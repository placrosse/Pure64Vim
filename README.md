Pure64 Vim Plugin
=================

This plugin allows for the syntax highlighting of Pure64 files with Vim.

### Installing

You can install this by using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) or a similar vim plugin manager.

With vim-plug, it's just a few lines in the vim rc file that look like this:

    call plug#begin('~/.local/share/nvim/plugged')
    Plug 'mhartington/oceanic-next'
    Plug 'bling/vim-airline'
    Plug 'ReturnInfinity/Pure64Vim'
    call plug#end()

### Sample

Here's a snapshot of what it looks like with Neovim. The plugins I used here are the same as the ones in the installation instructions.
